"""
conflict_resolver.py — Counterfactual-driven conflict resolution.

OLD behaviour (greedy blind):
  - Sort background apps by bandwidth usage, biggest first.
  - Throttle them one by one until we've recovered enough Mbps.
  - No idea whether throttling actually fixes the breaching metric.
  - Result: throttles the wrong apps when the root cause isn't bandwidth.

NEW behaviour (counterfactual-guided):
  1. Read counterfactual_details from inference.py to know WHICH metrics
     are breaching and by HOW MUCH (P95 vs limit).
  2. Decide the resolution STRATEGY per metric:
       - latency breach  → bandwidth is likely the cause → throttle BW
       - jitter breach   → buffer pressure is the cause → throttle BW + flag QoS
       - packet_loss breach → severe congestion → throttle BW aggressively
  3. Calculate the EXACT bandwidth delta needed to push P95 below the SLA,
     using the causal slope from the counterfactual (not a fixed Mbps number).
  4. Rank background apps by their CAUSAL IMPACT on the breaching metric
     (how much their bandwidth contributes to the target node's congestion),
     not just their raw usage size.
  5. Return per-action confidence scores so the frontend can show the user
     WHY each throttle action is being taken.

        slope = (p95 - current) / delta_mbps

      To bring p95 down to the SLA limit, we need to FREE UP:
